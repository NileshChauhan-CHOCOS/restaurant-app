# Socket Programming; Java Server with Multi-language Clients
This project demonstrates socket programming.How a Java-based TCP server can communicate with clients written in different programming languages such as Python, C++, C, and JavaScript.
It is designed for learning purposes to show how socket programming concepts are consistent across languages.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
### java-lan
The java-lan/ folder contains the Java server implementation. It listens for client connections on a given port and exchanges messages.
### Clients
The clients/ folder in language specific directory contains client implementations in:<br>
Python â€“ simple socket client using Pythonâ€™s socket module.<br>
C++ â€“ client using <sys/socket.h> APIs.
